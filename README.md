# Cura HealthBot ðŸ©ºðŸ’¬

Cura HealthBot is an AI-powered web-based healthcare assistant designed to help users analyze their symptoms and receive possible disease predictions â€” all from the comfort of their screen.

# Key Features

**Hybrid AI Model**: Combines a trained ML model for disease prediction and a conversational LLM for contextual Q&A.
**Symptom Analysis**: Users can describe symptoms in plain English, and the system will extract and process them intelligently.
**Disease Prediction**: Provides the most likely disease using a Random Forest classifier.
**Empathetic Chatbot Replies**: LLM (DeepSeek v3 via OpenRouter) provides emotional support with friendly tones.
**User Interface**: Fully interactive, responsive UI with dark mode, voice input, and multi-chat support.
**Landing Page + Disclaimer**: Professional homepage with project explanation, model transparency, and a privacy policy.
**Modern UI**: Sidebar navigation, chat animation, model switcher, and polished visual experience.

# Tech Stack

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Backend**: Python (Flask), Joblib, Pandas, Regex, CORS
**ML Model**: Random Forest (trained on disease-symptom dataset)
**NLP & LLM**: Custom NLP + DeepSeek Chat v3 via OpenRouter API
**Voice Input**: Web Speech API for voice symptom input

# How It Works

1. Users enter their symptoms (e.g., "I have chest pain and fever").
2. Backend uses NLP to extract relevant symptoms.
3. If symptoms are detected:
   - ML model predicts the likely disease.
   - Bot responds with a supportive, concise message.
4. If general health question:
   - The chatbot forwards it to an LLM (DeepSeek via OpenRouter) to respond warmly and contextually.

## How to Run Locally

### Option 1

1. Install Python 3
2. Clone this repo or download ZIP
3. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Open browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

### Option 2

1. Download or Clone the Repository
   You can clone the GitHub repository using:

git clone https://github.com/Amuz2516/curabot.git
Or simply download the ZIP file of this repo from GitHub and extract it.

2. Navigate to the Project Folder

cd curabot
Make sure youâ€™re in the folder where app.py exists.

3. Install Python Dependencies
   Install the necessary Python packages. If you have a requirements.txt file, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is not available, run manually:

pip install flask flask-cors joblib scikit-learn pandas requests

4. Run the Flask App
   Use this command in the terminal:

python app.py
Once running, Flask will output something like:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
5. Open the Web Application
Open any web browser and navigate to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
