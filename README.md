# Cura HealthBot ðŸ©ºðŸ’¬

Cura HealthBot is an AI-powered web-based healthcare assistant designed to help users analyze their symptoms and receive possible disease predictions â€” all from the comfort of their screen.

# Key Features

 **Hybrid AI Model**: Combines a trained ML model for disease prediction and a conversational LLM for contextual Q&A.
 **Symptom Analysis**: Users can describe symptoms in plain English, and the system will extract and process them intelligently.
 **Disease Prediction**: Provides the most likely disease using a Random Forest classifier.
 **Empathetic Chatbot Replies**: LLM (DeepSeek v3 via OpenRouter) provides emotional support with friendly tones.
 **User Interface**: Fully interactive, responsive UI with dark mode, voice input, and multi-chat support.
 **Landing Page + Disclaimer**: Professional homepage with project explanation, model transparency, and a privacy policy.
 **Modern UI**: Sidebar navigation, chat animation, model switcher, and polished visual experience.

 # Tech Stack

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
**Backend**: Python (Flask), Joblib, Pandas, Regex, CORS
**ML Model**: Random Forest (trained on disease-symptom dataset)
**NLP & LLM**: Custom NLP + DeepSeek Chat v3 via OpenRouter API
**Voice Input**: Web Speech API for voice symptom input

#  How It Works

1. Users enter their symptoms (e.g., "I have chest pain and fever").
2. Backend uses NLP to extract relevant symptoms.
3. If symptoms are detected:
   - ML model predicts the likely disease.
   - Bot responds with a supportive, concise message.
4. If general health question:
   - The chatbot forwards it to an LLM (DeepSeek via OpenRouter) to respond warmly and contextually.

## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

1. Install Python 3
